# what is continuous batching in LLM model inference?

Continuous batching is a technique used in large language model (LLM) inference to efficiently handle multiple incoming requests by dynamically managing batch sizes and processing times.

### Explanation

In the context of LLM model inference, batching refers to the process of grouping multiple requests or inputs together and processing them as a single batch. This can significantly improve the efficiency and throughput of the model computation by leveraging parallel processing capabilities.

### Key Points of Continuous Batching

1. **Dynamic Batch Management**:
   - Instead of waiting for a predetermined number of requests to form a batch, continuous batching dynamically adjusts the batch size based on incoming request rates, current processing load, and desired latency.
   
2. **Latency Improvements**:
   - Continuous batching aims to minimize the latency of individual requests while still taking advantage of batch processing efficiencies. It adjusts the batch size to balance between processing time and waiting time.
   
3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - By continuously adjusting the batch size, the system can optimize resource utilization, ensuring that computational resources are used effectively without idling or overloading.
   
4. **Concurrency Handling**:
   - Continuous batching techniques often involve complex concurrency management, ensuring that while some requests are being batched and processed, others are queued efficiently.

### Usage in LLM Inference

Continuous batching is especially relevant in LLM inference scenarios where:

- **Real-time Applications**: The technique is crucial for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time responses. It ensures that requests are handled promptly without unnecessary delays.
- **Variable Load**: In environments with variable or unpredictable incoming request loads, continuous batching dynamically adapts to changes in request patterns.
- **High Throughput**: For high-throughput applications, continuous batching can significantly boost overall performance by maximizing the number of requests processed per unit of time.

### Example Implementation Concept

While the precise implementation of continuous batching can vary, a simplified conceptual example can be provided:

```python
import time
import threading
from collections import deque

class ContinuousBatching:
    def __init__(self, batch_function, max_batch_size, max_wait_time):
        self.batch_function = batch_function
        self.max_batch_size = max_batch_size
        self.max_wait_time = max_wait_time
        self.queue = deque()
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)

    def add_request(self, request):
        with self.lock:
            self.queue.append(request)
            self.condition.notify()

    def process_requests(self):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                while len(self.queue) == 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                
                current_batch_size = min(self.max_batch_size, len(self.queue))
                requests_to_process = []
                
                for _ in range(current_batch_size):
                    requests_to_process.append(self.queue.popleft())
                
            # Process the batch of requests
            self.batch_function(requests_to_process)
            
            time.sleep(0.01)  # A small sleep to simulate continuous adjustment

def example_batch_function(requests):
    # Simulate batch processing (e.g., LLM inference)
    results = [f"Processed: {request}" for request in requests]
    print(results)

# Create instance of ContinuousBatching
batcher = ContinuousBatching(example_batch_function, max_batch_size=10, max_wait_time=1)

# Start the processing thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=batcher.process_requests)
thread.start()

# Example requests
batcher.add_request("Request 1")
batcher.add_request("Request 2")
# More requests can be added dynamically...

```

### Summary

- **Continuous batching** in LLM model inference dynamically forms and processes batches of requests based on incoming traffic patterns, optimizing both latency and throughput.
- It is used to handle variable loads efficiently and improve response times, especially critical in real-time applications.
- Implementing continuous batching involves managing queues, locks, and conditions to ensure smooth and efficient processing.

By leveraging continuous batching, systems performing LLM inference can achieve higher efficiency and better utilization of computational resources.

# what is `max_wait_time` used for, I see it is not being used
You're right. The `max_wait_time` parameter in the provided example was not actually used in the implementation. In real-world continuous batching implementations, `max_wait_time` is a critical factor for ensuring responsiveness when requests are sporadic or arrive at a slow rate.

Here's how the `max_wait_time` can be incorporated into the continuous batching process:

### Updated Implementation

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import random
import time
import threading
from collections import deque

class ContinuousBatching:
    def __init__(self, batch_function, max_batch_size, max_wait_time):
        self.batch_function = batch_function
        self.max_batch_size = max_batch_size
        self.max_wait_time = max_wait_time
        self.queue = deque()
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)

    def add_request(self, request):
        with self.lock:
            self.queue.append(request)
            self.condition.notify()

    def process_requests(self):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                processing_start_time = time.time()
                
                while len(self.queue) < self.max_batch_size:
                    remaining_time = self.max_wait_time - (time.time() - processing_start_time)
                    if remaining_time <= 0:
                        break
                    self.condition.wait(remaining_time)
                
                current_batch_size = min(self.max_batch_size, len(self.queue))
                requests_to_process = []
                
                for _ in range(current_batch_size):
                    requests_to_process.append(self.queue.popleft())
            if not requests_to_process:
                continue
            # Process the batch of requests
            self.batch_function(requests_to_process)
            
            time.sleep(0.01)  # A small sleep to simulate continuous adjustment

def example_batch_function(requests):
    # Simulate batch processing (e.g., LLM inference)
    results = [f"Processed: {request}" for request in requests]
    print(results)


random.seed(12345)

# Create instance of ContinuousBatching
batcher = ContinuousBatching(example_batch_function, max_batch_size=10, max_wait_time=1)

# Start the processing thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=batcher.process_requests)
thread.start()

# Example requests
for i in range(100):
    batcher.add_request(f"Request {i+1}")
    time.sleep(0.1 + random.randint(10, 80)*0.01)

# More requests can be added dynamically...
```

### Explanation of `max_wait_time`
- **Purpose**:
  - The `max_wait_time` parameter ensures that any requests waiting in the queue do not have to wait indefinitely to be processed. This is particularly important when incoming requests are sparse.
  - It balances between waiting to form a larger batch and processing the current smaller batch to maintain a reasonable latency.

### How It Works
- **Start Wait Timer**:
  - `processing_start_time` captures the current time when the waiting starts.
- **Dynamic Condition Waiting**:
  - The `condition.wait(remaining_time)` call waits for new requests or the remaining time whichever is shorter, ensuring partial batches do not wait longer than `max_wait_time`.
- **Check Remaining Time**:
  - `remaining_time` calculates the remaining time left to wait based on `max_wait_time`.
- **Batch Processing**:
  - If the queue doesn't reach `max_batch_size` within `max_wait_time`, the requests currently in the queue are processed.

### Summary
Incorporating `max_wait_time` into the continuous batching process enhances the responsiveness of the batching mechanism. By guaranteeing a maximum wait time, it prevents requests from waiting too long if the batch isn't filled quickly, striking a balance between latency and processing efficiency.
