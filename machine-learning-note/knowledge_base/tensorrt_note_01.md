# what's the difference when processing batch request and non-batch request in TensorRT?

Great question! When using **TensorRT** for inference, handling **batch requests** versus **non-batch (single) requests** involves some important differences in how input data is processed, memory is managed, and performance is optimized. Let me explain the key distinctions.

---

## 1. What is batch processing in TensorRT?

- **Batch processing** means running inference on multiple input samples **at once** in a single forward pass.
- A batch size > 1 means the input tensor shape includes a batch dimension (e.g., `[batch_size, channels, height, width]`).
- TensorRT builds engines optimized for a **fixed or dynamic batch size**, allowing efficient parallel computation.

---

## 2. Non-batch (single) request

- Batch size = 1.
- Input tensor shape corresponds to a single sample.
- Simpler memory management since only one input/output buffer is needed.
- Lower throughput but lower latency per request.
- May underutilize GPU resources if the model and hardware are designed for larger batch sizes.

---

## 3. Differences in processing batch vs non-batch requests in TensorRT

| Aspect                 | Batch Request                             | Non-Batch Request (Batch=1)              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Input shape**        | `[batch_size, ...]`                      | `[1, ...]`                               |
| **Memory allocation**  | Larger buffers to hold multiple samples | Smaller buffers for single sample        |
| **Engine optimization**| Engine built or optimized for batch size | Engine optimized for batch size 1        |
| **Throughput**         | Higher throughput due to parallelism     | Lower throughput                         |
| **Latency**            | Higher latency per batch, but amortized over samples | Lower latency per request               |
| **Preprocessing**      | Prepare batch input tensor                | Prepare single input tensor              |
| **Inference call**     | Single inference call for batch           | Single inference call per sample         |
| **Postprocessing**     | Process batch of outputs                   | Process single output                    |
| **Dynamic shapes**     | Can use dynamic batch size engines with optimization profiles | Can run with batch=1 profile              |

---

## 4. Practical considerations

- **Batch size choice affects memory usage:** Larger batches require more GPU memory.
- **Batching improves GPU utilization:** GPUs are designed for parallel workloads; batching helps achieve higher throughput.
- **Latency tradeoff:** For real-time applications, batch size 1 may be preferred for minimal latency.
- **Dynamic batch size:** TensorRT supports dynamic batch sizes via optimization profiles, allowing flexible batch processing without rebuilding the engine.

---

## 5. Example

Suppose you have an image classification model:

- **Batch=1:** You feed one image tensor of shape `[1, 3, 224, 224]`.
- **Batch=8:** You feed eight images concatenated into one tensor `[8, 3, 224, 224]`.
- TensorRT executes one optimized kernel for all 8 images in the batch.

## Summary

| Processing Type      | When to Use                      | Pros                               | Cons                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Non-batch (batch=1) | Low latency, real-time inference | Low latency per request            | Lower throughput, GPU underutilized |
| Batch processing     | High throughput, offline inference | Higher throughput, better GPU utilization | Higher latency per batch          |

If you want, I can help you with code examples showing how to set up batch and non-batch inference in TensorRT!

# tell me the detail of TensorRT Engine optimization for batch request, give me an example

Absolutely! Let me explain in detail how **TensorRT engine optimization works for batch requests**, and then provide a concrete example to illustrate the process.

---

## TensorRT Engine Optimization for Batch Requests: Details

### 1. What is a TensorRT Engine?

- A **TensorRT engine** is a highly optimized runtime representation of your neural network model.
- It contains optimized CUDA kernels, memory layouts, and execution plans tailored for specific input shapes and batch sizes.

---

### 2. Batch Size in TensorRT Engine

- When building a TensorRT engine, you specify the **maximum batch size** the engine supports.
- TensorRT optimizes the engine for that batch size to maximize throughput and GPU utilization.
- The engine expects inputs shaped as `[batch_size, ...]` where `batch_size` â‰¤ max batch size.

---

### 3. Optimization Process for Batch Requests

- **Layer Fusion:** TensorRT fuses multiple layers (e.g., convolution + activation) into single kernels, reducing memory bandwidth and kernel launches.
- **Kernel Auto-Tuning:** For each layer and batch size, TensorRT benchmarks multiple CUDA kernels and picks the fastest.
- **Memory Layout Optimization:** TensorRT chooses tensor layouts (e.g., NCHW, NHWC) that maximize memory coalescing and cache usage for the batch.
- **Dynamic Batching (optional):** Using **optimization profiles**, TensorRT can support a range of batch sizes dynamically without rebuilding the engine.
- **Parallel Execution:** The engine schedules operations to maximize GPU parallelism across the batch dimension.

---

### 4. Benefits of Batch Optimization

- **Higher throughput:** Processing multiple inputs in parallel reduces per-sample overhead.
- **Better GPU utilization:** Larger batch sizes keep GPU cores busy.
- **Reduced kernel launch overhead:** Fewer launches per sample.
- **Improved memory efficiency:** Optimized buffer reuse and layout.

---

## Example: Building and Running a TensorRT Engine for Batch Inference

Suppose you have an ONNX model and want to build a TensorRT engine optimized for batch size 8.

---

### Step 1: Create a builder and network

```python
import tensorrt as trt

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
builder = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)
network = builder.create_network(flags=1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)

with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f:
    parser.parse(f.read())
```

---

### Step 2: Set max batch size and workspace size

```python
builder.max_batch_size = 8  # Max batch size supported
builder.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1 GB workspace for optimization
```

---

### Step 3: Build the engine

```python
engine = builder.build_cuda_engine(network)
```

- TensorRT will optimize kernels and memory layouts for **batch size 8**.
- The engine expects input tensors shaped `[8, C, H, W]`.

---

### Step 4: Run inference with batch inputs

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

# Create execution context
context = engine.create_execution_context()

# Prepare input data: batch of 8 images
input_data = np.random.random((8, 3, 224, 224)).astype(np.float32)

# Allocate device memory and copy input
d_input = cuda.mem_alloc(input_data.nbytes)
cuda.memcpy_htod(d_input, input_data)

# Allocate output memory (size depends on model output)
output_size = trt.volume(engine.get_binding_shape(1)) * engine.max_batch_size
d_output = cuda.mem_alloc(output_size * np.dtype(np.float32).itemsize)

# Execute inference
context.execute(batch_size=8, bindings=[int(d_input), int(d_output)])

# Copy output back to host
output = np.empty(output_size, dtype=np.float32)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(output, d_output)
```

---

### Notes:

- The engine is optimized for batch size 8, so calling `execute` with batch size 8 utilizes the optimized kernels.
- If you want to support variable batch sizes, you need to use **dynamic shapes and optimization profiles** (TensorRT 7+).

---

## Summary

| Step                      | Description                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Build engine with max batch size | TensorRT optimizes kernels/layouts for batch |
| Input shape               | `[batch_size, ...]` matching engine batch size |
| Kernel fusion & tuning    | Optimized for batch to maximize throughput  |
| Execution                 | Single call processes entire batch           |

---

If you want, I can also explain how to use **dynamic shapes and optimization profiles** in TensorRT to support flexible batch sizes! Would you like that?

# how to use dynamic shapes and optimization profiles in TensorRT to support flexible batch sizes

Great question! Using **dynamic shapes** and **optimization profiles** in TensorRT allows you to build an engine that supports **flexible batch sizes** (and even dynamic spatial dimensions), so you don't have to rebuild the engine for different input sizes.

---

## Why dynamic shapes and optimization profiles?

- Traditional TensorRT engines are built with **fixed input dimensions**, including a fixed batch size.
- If you want to run inference with varying batch sizes (e.g., sometimes 1, sometimes 8), you need an engine that supports **dynamic batch sizes**.
- **Optimization profiles** specify the allowed input shape ranges (min, opt, max) for each dynamic dimension.
- TensorRT uses these profiles to generate optimized kernels for the specified ranges.

---

## Step-by-step: How to use dynamic shapes and optimization profiles for flexible batch sizes

---

### 1. Create the builder, network, and parser with explicit batch flag

```python
import tensorrt as trt

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
builder = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)
network = builder.create_network(flags=1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)

with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f:
    parser.parse(f.read())
```

- The `EXPLICIT_BATCH` flag means the batch dimension is treated explicitly in the network, allowing dynamic batch sizes.

---

### 2. Create an optimization profile

```python
profile = builder.create_optimization_profile()
```

---

### 3. Set dynamic input shapes in the profile

Suppose your input tensor name is `"input"` and shape is `[batch_size, 3, 224, 224]`.

```python
# Set allowed input shapes for the profile
profile.set_shape(
    "input",          # input tensor name
    min=(1, 3, 224, 224),   # minimum shape allowed
    opt=(4, 3, 224, 224),   # optimal shape (used for kernel tuning)
    max=(16, 3, 224, 224)   # maximum shape allowed
)
```

- You specify the **minimum**, **optimum**, and **maximum** allowed shapes for the input tensor.
- The batch dimension here is dynamic, allowed to vary between 1 and 16.

---

### 4. Add the profile to the builder config

```python
config = builder.create_builder_config()
config.add_optimization_profile(profile)
config.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1GB workspace
```

---

### 5. Build the engine with dynamic shapes

```python
engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
```

---

### 6. Run inference with different batch sizes

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

context = engine.create_execution_context()

# Set binding shape for dynamic input
batch_size = 8
context.set_binding_shape(0, (batch_size, 3, 224, 224))

# Prepare input data
input_data = np.random.random((batch_size, 3, 224, 224)).astype(np.float32)

# Allocate device memory
d_input = cuda.mem_alloc(input_data.nbytes)
d_output = cuda.mem_alloc(engine.get_binding_shape(1).volume() * np.dtype(np.float32).itemsize)

# Copy input data to device
cuda.memcpy_htod(d_input, input_data)

# Execute inference
context.execute_v2(bindings=[int(d_input), int(d_output)])

# Copy output back to host
output_shape = context.get_binding_shape(1)
output = np.empty(output_shape.volume(), dtype=np.float32)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(output, d_output)
```

- Before calling `execute_v2()`, you **must set the input binding shape** to the actual input shape.
- The batch size can vary between the min and max specified in the optimization profile.

---

## Summary

| Step                      | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use explicit batch flag    | `create_network(EXPLICIT_BATCH)`                |
| Create optimization profile| Define min, opt, max shapes for dynamic inputs  |
| Add profile to config      | `config.add_optimization_profile(profile)`      |
| Build engine with config   | Builds engine supporting dynamic shapes         |
| Set binding shape at runtime| Tell context actual input shape before inference |
| Run inference             | Use `execute_v2()` with dynamic input sizes      |

---

## Additional tips

- You can create **multiple optimization profiles** for different input ranges.
- If you exceed the max shape in the profile at runtime, inference will fail.
- Use `context.get_binding_shape()` to query output shapes if they depend on input.

```

---

### Explanation

- **Explicit batch mode:** The network is created with `EXPLICIT_BATCH` flag so the batch dimension is dynamic.
- **Optimization profile:** Defines allowed ranges for batch size and spatial dimensions (`height` and `width`).
- **Dynamic input shape:** Before inference, `context.set_binding_shape()` sets the actual input shape.
- **Memory allocation:** Buffers are allocated based on max shapes; actual shapes are set dynamically.
- **Inference:** `execute_async_v2()` runs the engine with the specified dynamic input shape.

---

### Notes

- Your ONNX model must support dynamic input shapes (e.g., batch size and spatial dimensions marked as `-1` or dynamic).
- The optimization profileâ€™s `min`, `opt`, and `max` shapes must cover the input shapes you plan to use.
- You can create multiple optimization profiles if needed.

# I enable fp16 quantization when converting onnx model to TensorRT model with `trtexec`, I find the quantization error is too large,  about 1e-03, how to minimize it?

Great question! When enabling **FP16 quantization** in TensorRT via `trtexec`, some quantization error is expected because FP16 has lower precision than FP32. However, an error around **1e-3** might be larger than desired depending on your application. Here are some strategies to **minimize FP16 quantization error** and improve accuracy:

---

## 1. Use Calibration for INT8 (if applicable)

- FP16 is a **floating-point format** and generally does **not require calibration**.
- But if you are mixing FP16 with INT8 quantization, **calibration is critical** to minimize quantization error.
- For pure FP16, calibration is not used, so focus on other strategies.

---

## 2. Enable Tensor Cores and Proper Compute Capability

- Make sure your GPU supports FP16 efficiently (e.g., NVIDIA Volta, Turing, Ampere architectures).
- Use the latest TensorRT version and CUDA toolkit to get improved FP16 kernels.
- Use the flag `--useCudaGraph` in `trtexec` to leverage CUDA Graphs, which may improve performance but not accuracy directly.

---

## 3. Adjust Precision and Fallback Settings

- Use **mixed precision** mode: allow fallback to FP32 for layers where FP16 causes large errors.
- In `trtexec`, use `--fp16` to enable FP16, but also consider `--strictTypeConstraints` flag:
  - If enabled, forces all layers to FP16, potentially increasing error.
  - If disabled, TensorRT can selectively keep some layers in FP32 to preserve accuracy.

Example:

```bash
trtexec --onnx=model.onnx --fp16 --strictTypeConstraints=0
```

---

## 4. Use Layer Precision Overrides

- Some layers are more sensitive to precision loss (e.g., softmax, normalization).
- You can override precision on a per-layer basis in your TensorRT API code (not directly via `trtexec`).
- Keep sensitive layers in FP32 while allowing others in FP16.

---

## 5. Increase Model Input Precision

- Sometimes input preprocessing or input data precision affects quantization error.
- Ensure inputs are normalized and preprocessed consistently.
- Avoid unnecessary type conversions before feeding into TensorRT.

---

## 6. Profile and Compare Intermediate Outputs

- Use TensorRT's **debugging and profiling tools** to compare intermediate layer outputs between FP32 and FP16.
- Identify layers causing large deviations and consider keeping them in FP32.

---

## 7. Use Latest TensorRT Version

- Each TensorRT release improves FP16 kernel implementations and accuracy.
- Upgrade to the latest stable version.

---

## 8. Example `trtexec` command with accuracy-focused options

```bash
trtexec --onnx=model.onnx --fp16 --strictTypeConstraints=0 --workspace=4096 --verbose
```

- `--strictTypeConstraints=0`: allows mixed precision fallback.
- `--workspace=4096`: increase workspace size to allow more optimization.
- `--verbose`: see detailed logs.

---

## Summary

| Strategy                         | Description                                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use mixed precision fallback     | Allow TensorRT to keep sensitive layers in FP32 |
| Avoid `--strictTypeConstraints=1` | Prevent forcing all layers to FP16, reduce error |
| Profile intermediate outputs     | Identify problematic layers                    |
| Upgrade TensorRT                 | Benefit from improved FP16 kernels             |
| Ensure proper input preprocessing| Consistent input precision and normalization   |

# In TensorRT how to tell which layers affect output precision most and how to exclude certain layers from quantization?

Great question! In TensorRT, understanding which layers impact output precision most and selectively excluding certain layers from quantization (e.g., forcing them to run in FP32 instead of FP16 or INT8) is key to balancing **performance** and **accuracy**.

---

## 1. How to identify layers that affect output precision most?

### a) Use TensorRTâ€™s **Layer Profiling and Debugging Tools**

- **Verbose logging:**  
  Run `trtexec` with `--verbose` to get detailed layer information during engine building and execution.

- **TensorRT Profiler API:**  
  When using the TensorRT C++ or Python API, you can enable profiling to get per-layer execution times and memory usage.

- **Compare intermediate outputs:**  
  - Export intermediate outputs from the FP32 and quantized engines.  
  - Compare layer outputs to identify layers with large deviations.

### b) Use **Precision Calibration and Accuracy Tools**

- For INT8, calibration can reveal layers with large quantization error.
- Tools like NVIDIAâ€™s **TensorRT Inspector** or third-party utilities can help visualize layer-wise precision impact.

---

## 2. How to exclude certain layers from quantization / force FP32 precision?

### a) Using the TensorRT API (C++ or Python)

- TensorRT allows you to **set precision per layer** via the `setPrecision()` and `setOutputType()` methods on `ILayer` objects.

- Example in C++:

```cpp
auto layer = network->getLayer(index);
layer->setPrecision(nvinfer1::DataType::kFLOAT);
layer->setOutputType(0, nvinfer1::DataType::kFLOAT);
```

- This forces the layer and its output to run in FP32, bypassing FP16 or INT8 quantization.

### b) During engine building with builder config

- Use **builder config flags** like `--strictTypeConstraints` (in `trtexec`) to allow mixed precision.

- If you want to exclude specific layers, you must do it programmatically as above.

### c) Using **Layer Precision Overrides in ONNX Parser**

- Some parsers allow hints or annotations to control layer precision, but this is more limited.

---

## 3. Practical workflow to improve precision

1. **Build baseline FP32 engine.**

2. **Build FP16 or INT8 engine with profiling enabled.**

3. **Compare intermediate outputs** to identify layers with significant precision loss.

4. **In your TensorRT network definition code, force those layers to FP32** using `setPrecision()` and `setOutputType()`.

5. **Rebuild and test the engine** for accuracy and performance trade-offs.

---

## 4. Example: Forcing FP32 on a layer in Python API

```python
for i in range(network.num_layers):
    layer = network.get_layer(i)
    if layer.name == "some_sensitive_layer":
        layer.precision = trt.DataType.FLOAT
        layer.set_output_type(0, trt.DataType.FLOAT)
```

---

## Summary

| Step                            | Description                             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Identify problematic layers     | Use verbose logs, profiling, output comparison |
| Force layer precision           | Use `setPrecision()` and `setOutputType()` on layers |
| Allow mixed precision           | Disable strict type constraints       |
| Iterate and test               | Balance accuracy and performance      |

If you want, I can help you with a sample script to extract intermediate outputs or a full example of layer precision overrides!

# I use `google-bert/bert-large-uncased`, and can you tell me which layers impact precision most during quantizaiton?

Great question! When quantizing large Transformer models like **BERT-large-uncased**, certain layers are more sensitive to reduced precision (FP16 or INT8) and tend to impact overall model accuracy more significantly.

---

## Layers in BERT that impact precision most during quantization

### 1. **Layer Normalization layers**

- LayerNorm involves computing mean and variance, followed by scaling and shifting.
- These operations are sensitive to precision loss because small numerical errors can propagate.
- Quantizing LayerNorm often causes noticeable accuracy degradation.
- **Recommendation:** Keep LayerNorm layers in **FP32**.

### 2. **Softmax layers**

- Softmax computes exponentials and normalization, which require high numerical precision.
- Quantizing softmax can cause instability and large errors.
- **Recommendation:** Keep softmax layers in **FP32**.

### 3. **Embedding layers**

- Embeddings map discrete tokens to continuous vectors.
- While embeddings can sometimes tolerate quantization, aggressive quantization can hurt semantic representation.
- **Recommendation:** Often keep embeddings in FP32 or carefully calibrate them.

### 4. **Attention score computation**

- The scaled dot-product attention involves matrix multiplications and softmax.
- The softmax and scaling steps are sensitive.
- Quantizing the **attention score calculation** and **softmax** can degrade performance.
- **Recommendation:** Keep attention softmax and scaling in FP32.

### 5. **Output layers**

- The final classification or prediction layers can be sensitive, especially if they produce logits for softmax.
- Quantizing these layers might reduce accuracy.
- **Recommendation:** Keep output layers in FP32.

---

## Why these layers?

- They involve **nonlinear operations** or **statistical computations** that require high numeric stability.
- Errors here propagate and amplify through the network.

---

## How to apply this in TensorRT quantization?

- Use **layer precision overrides** to force these sensitive layers to FP32.
- Allow other layers (e.g., matrix multiplications, GELU activations) to run in FP16 or INT8 to gain speedups.
- Use **calibration** data to fine-tune INT8 quantization.

---

## Practical tips

- Start with FP16 quantization and check accuracy.
- Identify layers causing accuracy drops by:
  - Comparing intermediate outputs between FP32 and FP16.
  - Using profiling tools or accuracy benchmarks.
- Force LayerNorm, softmax, and output layers to FP32.
- For INT8, perform careful calibration and consider mixed precision.

If you want, I can help you with scripts or methods to extract intermediate outputs from your TensorRT engine to verify which layers cause precision loss!

# yes, help me with scripts or methods to extract intermediate outputs from your TensorRT engine to verify which layers cause precision loss

Absolutely! Extracting intermediate outputs from a TensorRT engine is a powerful way to **debug precision loss** and identify which layers impact accuracy during quantization.

Below, Iâ€™ll guide you through **how to modify your TensorRT inference code to capture intermediate layer outputs**, plus provide a **Python example** using the TensorRT Python API.

---

# How to Extract Intermediate Outputs in TensorRT

---

## 1. Build the engine with intermediate layer outputs

- By default, TensorRT engines expose only the **final outputs**.
- To get intermediate outputs, you need to **mark specific layersâ€™ outputs as network outputs** during network creation.
- This means:
  - When building the network (from ONNX or manually), call `network.mark_output(tensor)` on the intermediate tensors you want to capture.
  
---

## 2. Modify your ONNX parsing or network creation step

If youâ€™re parsing an ONNX model:

- After parsing, **get the layer or tensor you want** and mark it as output.

Example (Python):

```python
# Assume 'network' is your INetworkDefinition after parsing ONNX
for i in range(network.num_layers):
    layer = network.get_layer(i)
    # Example: mark output of layer 10 as output
    if i == 10:
        network.mark_output(layer.get_output(0))
```

---

## 3. Allocate buffers for all outputs (final + intermediate)

- The engine will now have more bindings (inputs + outputs).
- You must allocate device and host buffers for **all outputs**.
- Use `engine.get_binding_shape()` and `engine.binding_is_input()` to distinguish inputs and outputs.

---

## 4. Run inference and copy intermediate outputs back

- After execution, copy all outputs from device to host.
- You can then compare intermediate outputs between FP32 and quantized engines.

# Complete Python Example Snippet

```python
import tensorrt as trt
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)

def build_engine_with_intermediate_outputs(onnx_path, intermediate_layer_indices):
    builder = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)
    network = builder.create_network(flags=1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
    parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)

    with open(onnx_path, 'rb') as f:
        parser.parse(f.read())

    # Mark intermediate layers as outputs
    for idx in intermediate_layer_indices:
        layer = network.get_layer(idx)
        network.mark_output(layer.get_output(0))

    config = builder.create_builder_config()
    config.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1GB
    engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
    return engine

def allocate_buffers(engine):
    inputs, outputs, bindings = [], [], []
    stream = cuda.Stream()

    for i in range(engine.num_bindings):
        size = trt.volume(engine.get_binding_shape(i))
        dtype = trt.nptype(engine.get_binding_dtype(i))
        host_mem = cuda.pagelocked_empty(size, dtype)
        device_mem = cuda.mem_alloc(host_mem.nbytes)
        bindings.append(int(device_mem))
        if engine.binding_is_input(i):
            inputs.append({'host': host_mem, 'device': device_mem})
        else:
            outputs.append({'host': host_mem, 'device': device_mem})

    return inputs, outputs, bindings, stream

def do_inference(context, bindings, inputs, outputs, stream, batch_size, input_shape):
    context.set_binding_shape(0, input_shape)

    # Prepare dummy input
    input_data = np.random.random(input_shape).astype(np.float32).ravel()
    np.copyto(inputs[0]['host'], input_data)

    cuda.memcpy_htod_async(inputs[0]['device'], inputs[0]['host'], stream)
    context.execute_async_v2(bindings=bindings, stream_handle=stream.handle)
    cuda.memcpy_dtoh_async(outputs[0]['host'], outputs[0]['device'], stream)
    stream.synchronize()

    # Collect all outputs (including intermediate)
    results = []
    for out in outputs:
        results.append(np.array(out['host']).copy())
    return results

# Usage example
onnx_model = 'model.onnx'
intermediate_layers = [10, 20, 30]  # layer indices you want to inspect

engine = build_engine_with_intermediate_outputs(onnx_model, intermediate_layers)
context = engine.create_execution_context()
inputs, outputs, bindings, stream = allocate_buffers(engine)

batch_size = 1
input_shape = (batch_size, 3, 224, 224)

outputs_data = do_inference(context, bindings, inputs, outputs, stream, batch_size, input_shape)

for i, data in enumerate(outputs_data):
    print(f"Output {i} shape: {data.shape}")
```

## Notes

- **Choosing layers:** You need to know which layers to mark. You can inspect the network layers by printing their names or indices.
- **Performance:** Marking many intermediate outputs increases memory and runtime overhead.
- **Comparing outputs:** Run this for FP32 and quantized engines with the same inputs to see where outputs differ significantly.
