# what's the difference when processing batch request and non-batch request in TensorRT?

Great question! When using **TensorRT** for inference, handling **batch requests** versus **non-batch (single) requests** involves some important differences in how input data is processed, memory is managed, and performance is optimized. Let me explain the key distinctions.

---

## 1. What is batch processing in TensorRT?

- **Batch processing** means running inference on multiple input samples **at once** in a single forward pass.
- A batch size > 1 means the input tensor shape includes a batch dimension (e.g., `[batch_size, channels, height, width]`).
- TensorRT builds engines optimized for a **fixed or dynamic batch size**, allowing efficient parallel computation.

---

## 2. Non-batch (single) request

- Batch size = 1.
- Input tensor shape corresponds to a single sample.
- Simpler memory management since only one input/output buffer is needed.
- Lower throughput but lower latency per request.
- May underutilize GPU resources if the model and hardware are designed for larger batch sizes.

---

## 3. Differences in processing batch vs non-batch requests in TensorRT

| Aspect                 | Batch Request                             | Non-Batch Request (Batch=1)              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Input shape**        | `[batch_size, ...]`                      | `[1, ...]`                               |
| **Memory allocation**  | Larger buffers to hold multiple samples | Smaller buffers for single sample        |
| **Engine optimization**| Engine built or optimized for batch size | Engine optimized for batch size 1        |
| **Throughput**         | Higher throughput due to parallelism     | Lower throughput                         |
| **Latency**            | Higher latency per batch, but amortized over samples | Lower latency per request               |
| **Preprocessing**      | Prepare batch input tensor                | Prepare single input tensor              |
| **Inference call**     | Single inference call for batch           | Single inference call per sample         |
| **Postprocessing**     | Process batch of outputs                   | Process single output                    |
| **Dynamic shapes**     | Can use dynamic batch size engines with optimization profiles | Can run with batch=1 profile              |

---

## 4. Practical considerations

- **Batch size choice affects memory usage:** Larger batches require more GPU memory.
- **Batching improves GPU utilization:** GPUs are designed for parallel workloads; batching helps achieve higher throughput.
- **Latency tradeoff:** For real-time applications, batch size 1 may be preferred for minimal latency.
- **Dynamic batch size:** TensorRT supports dynamic batch sizes via optimization profiles, allowing flexible batch processing without rebuilding the engine.

---

## 5. Example

Suppose you have an image classification model:

- **Batch=1:** You feed one image tensor of shape `[1, 3, 224, 224]`.
- **Batch=8:** You feed eight images concatenated into one tensor `[8, 3, 224, 224]`.
- TensorRT executes one optimized kernel for all 8 images in the batch.

## Summary

| Processing Type      | When to Use                      | Pros                               | Cons                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Non-batch (batch=1) | Low latency, real-time inference | Low latency per request            | Lower throughput, GPU underutilized |
| Batch processing     | High throughput, offline inference | Higher throughput, better GPU utilization | Higher latency per batch          |

If you want, I can help you with code examples showing how to set up batch and non-batch inference in TensorRT!

# tell me the detail of TensorRT Engine optimization for batch request, give me an example

Absolutely! Let me explain in detail how **TensorRT engine optimization works for batch requests**, and then provide a concrete example to illustrate the process.

---

## TensorRT Engine Optimization for Batch Requests: Details

### 1. What is a TensorRT Engine?

- A **TensorRT engine** is a highly optimized runtime representation of your neural network model.
- It contains optimized CUDA kernels, memory layouts, and execution plans tailored for specific input shapes and batch sizes.

---

### 2. Batch Size in TensorRT Engine

- When building a TensorRT engine, you specify the **maximum batch size** the engine supports.
- TensorRT optimizes the engine for that batch size to maximize throughput and GPU utilization.
- The engine expects inputs shaped as `[batch_size, ...]` where `batch_size` â‰¤ max batch size.

---

### 3. Optimization Process for Batch Requests

- **Layer Fusion:** TensorRT fuses multiple layers (e.g., convolution + activation) into single kernels, reducing memory bandwidth and kernel launches.
- **Kernel Auto-Tuning:** For each layer and batch size, TensorRT benchmarks multiple CUDA kernels and picks the fastest.
- **Memory Layout Optimization:** TensorRT chooses tensor layouts (e.g., NCHW, NHWC) that maximize memory coalescing and cache usage for the batch.
- **Dynamic Batching (optional):** Using **optimization profiles**, TensorRT can support a range of batch sizes dynamically without rebuilding the engine.
- **Parallel Execution:** The engine schedules operations to maximize GPU parallelism across the batch dimension.

---

### 4. Benefits of Batch Optimization

- **Higher throughput:** Processing multiple inputs in parallel reduces per-sample overhead.
- **Better GPU utilization:** Larger batch sizes keep GPU cores busy.
- **Reduced kernel launch overhead:** Fewer launches per sample.
- **Improved memory efficiency:** Optimized buffer reuse and layout.

---

## Example: Building and Running a TensorRT Engine for Batch Inference

Suppose you have an ONNX model and want to build a TensorRT engine optimized for batch size 8.

---

### Step 1: Create a builder and network

```python
import tensorrt as trt

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
builder = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)
network = builder.create_network(flags=1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)

with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f:
    parser.parse(f.read())
```

---

### Step 2: Set max batch size and workspace size

```python
builder.max_batch_size = 8  # Max batch size supported
builder.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1 GB workspace for optimization
```

---

### Step 3: Build the engine

```python
engine = builder.build_cuda_engine(network)
```

- TensorRT will optimize kernels and memory layouts for **batch size 8**.
- The engine expects input tensors shaped `[8, C, H, W]`.

---

### Step 4: Run inference with batch inputs

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

# Create execution context
context = engine.create_execution_context()

# Prepare input data: batch of 8 images
input_data = np.random.random((8, 3, 224, 224)).astype(np.float32)

# Allocate device memory and copy input
d_input = cuda.mem_alloc(input_data.nbytes)
cuda.memcpy_htod(d_input, input_data)

# Allocate output memory (size depends on model output)
output_size = trt.volume(engine.get_binding_shape(1)) * engine.max_batch_size
d_output = cuda.mem_alloc(output_size * np.dtype(np.float32).itemsize)

# Execute inference
context.execute(batch_size=8, bindings=[int(d_input), int(d_output)])

# Copy output back to host
output = np.empty(output_size, dtype=np.float32)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(output, d_output)
```

---

### Notes:

- The engine is optimized for batch size 8, so calling `execute` with batch size 8 utilizes the optimized kernels.
- If you want to support variable batch sizes, you need to use **dynamic shapes and optimization profiles** (TensorRT 7+).

---

## Summary

| Step                      | Description                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Build engine with max batch size | TensorRT optimizes kernels/layouts for batch |
| Input shape               | `[batch_size, ...]` matching engine batch size |
| Kernel fusion & tuning    | Optimized for batch to maximize throughput  |
| Execution                 | Single call processes entire batch           |

---

If you want, I can also explain how to use **dynamic shapes and optimization profiles** in TensorRT to support flexible batch sizes! Would you like that?

# how to use dynamic shapes and optimization profiles in TensorRT to support flexible batch sizes

Great question! Using **dynamic shapes** and **optimization profiles** in TensorRT allows you to build an engine that supports **flexible batch sizes** (and even dynamic spatial dimensions), so you don't have to rebuild the engine for different input sizes.

---

## Why dynamic shapes and optimization profiles?

- Traditional TensorRT engines are built with **fixed input dimensions**, including a fixed batch size.
- If you want to run inference with varying batch sizes (e.g., sometimes 1, sometimes 8), you need an engine that supports **dynamic batch sizes**.
- **Optimization profiles** specify the allowed input shape ranges (min, opt, max) for each dynamic dimension.
- TensorRT uses these profiles to generate optimized kernels for the specified ranges.

---

## Step-by-step: How to use dynamic shapes and optimization profiles for flexible batch sizes

---

### 1. Create the builder, network, and parser with explicit batch flag

```python
import tensorrt as trt

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger(trt.Logger.WARNING)
builder = trt.Builder(TRT_LOGGER)
network = builder.create_network(flags=1 << int(trt.NetworkDefinitionCreationFlag.EXPLICIT_BATCH))
parser = trt.OnnxParser(network, TRT_LOGGER)

with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f:
    parser.parse(f.read())
```

- The `EXPLICIT_BATCH` flag means the batch dimension is treated explicitly in the network, allowing dynamic batch sizes.

---

### 2. Create an optimization profile

```python
profile = builder.create_optimization_profile()
```

---

### 3. Set dynamic input shapes in the profile

Suppose your input tensor name is `"input"` and shape is `[batch_size, 3, 224, 224]`.

```python
# Set allowed input shapes for the profile
profile.set_shape(
    "input",          # input tensor name
    min=(1, 3, 224, 224),   # minimum shape allowed
    opt=(4, 3, 224, 224),   # optimal shape (used for kernel tuning)
    max=(16, 3, 224, 224)   # maximum shape allowed
)
```

- You specify the **minimum**, **optimum**, and **maximum** allowed shapes for the input tensor.
- The batch dimension here is dynamic, allowed to vary between 1 and 16.

---

### 4. Add the profile to the builder config

```python
config = builder.create_builder_config()
config.add_optimization_profile(profile)
config.max_workspace_size = 1 << 30  # 1GB workspace
```

---

### 5. Build the engine with dynamic shapes

```python
engine = builder.build_engine(network, config)
```

---

### 6. Run inference with different batch sizes

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit
import numpy as np

context = engine.create_execution_context()

# Set binding shape for dynamic input
batch_size = 8
context.set_binding_shape(0, (batch_size, 3, 224, 224))

# Prepare input data
input_data = np.random.random((batch_size, 3, 224, 224)).astype(np.float32)

# Allocate device memory
d_input = cuda.mem_alloc(input_data.nbytes)
d_output = cuda.mem_alloc(engine.get_binding_shape(1).volume() * np.dtype(np.float32).itemsize)

# Copy input data to device
cuda.memcpy_htod(d_input, input_data)

# Execute inference
context.execute_v2(bindings=[int(d_input), int(d_output)])

# Copy output back to host
output_shape = context.get_binding_shape(1)
output = np.empty(output_shape.volume(), dtype=np.float32)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh(output, d_output)
```

- Before calling `execute_v2()`, you **must set the input binding shape** to the actual input shape.
- The batch size can vary between the min and max specified in the optimization profile.

---

## Summary

| Step                      | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use explicit batch flag    | `create_network(EXPLICIT_BATCH)`                |
| Create optimization profile| Define min, opt, max shapes for dynamic inputs  |
| Add profile to config      | `config.add_optimization_profile(profile)`      |
| Build engine with config   | Builds engine supporting dynamic shapes         |
| Set binding shape at runtime| Tell context actual input shape before inference |
| Run inference             | Use `execute_v2()` with dynamic input sizes      |

---

## Additional tips

- You can create **multiple optimization profiles** for different input ranges.
- If you exceed the max shape in the profile at runtime, inference will fail.
- Use `context.get_binding_shape()` to query output shapes if they depend on input.

### Explanation

- **Explicit batch mode:** The network is created with `EXPLICIT_BATCH` flag so the batch dimension is dynamic.
- **Optimization profile:** Defines allowed ranges for batch size and spatial dimensions (`height` and `width`).
- **Dynamic input shape:** Before inference, `context.set_binding_shape()` sets the actual input shape.
- **Memory allocation:** Buffers are allocated based on max shapes; actual shapes are set dynamically.
- **Inference:** `execute_async_v2()` runs the engine with the specified dynamic input shape.

---

### Notes

- Your ONNX model must support dynamic input shapes (e.g., batch size and spatial dimensions marked as `-1` or dynamic).
- The optimization profileâ€™s `min`, `opt`, and `max` shapes must cover the input shapes you plan to use.
- You can create multiple optimization profiles if needed.

If you want, I can help you generate a dynamic ONNX model or explain how to inspect the engineâ€™s supported shapes!
