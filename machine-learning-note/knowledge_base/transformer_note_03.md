# how to confirm the input and output names when exporting a transformer model to ONNX?

To confirm the input and output names when exporting a transformer model to ONNX, you can follow these steps:

1. **Export the Model to ONNX:** When exporting the model, you generally specify the input and output names in the `torch.onnx.export` function.

2. **Inspect the ONNX Model:** After exporting, use tools like `onnx` library or `Netron` to inspect the model and confirm the input and output names.

Here’s a detailed example using the `transformers` library and PyTorch:

### Step 1: Export the Model to ONNX

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import onnx

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Tokenize input
input_text = "Exporting a transformer model to ONNX"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Provide input and output names
input_names = ["input_ids", "attention_mask"]
output_names = ["output"]

# Model export
torch.onnx.export(
    model, 
    (inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask']),
    "transformer_model.onnx",
    input_names=input_names,
    output_names=output_names,
    dynamic_axes={'input_ids': {0: 'batch_size'}, 'attention_mask': {0: 'batch_size'}, 'output': {0: 'batch_size'}}
)
```

### Step 2: Inspect the ONNX Model

#### Using the `onnx` Library

After exporting, you can inspect the model using the `onnx` library to ensure the input and output names are correct.

```python
import onnx

# Load the ONNX model
onnx_model = onnx.load("transformer_model.onnx")

# Check the input and output names
print("Inputs:")
for input in onnx_model.graph.input:
    print(input.name)

print("\nOutputs:")
for output in onnx_model.graph.output:
    print(output.name)
```

#### Using Netron

Alternatively, you can use Netron, a web-based viewer for neural network models.

1. Download Netron from [Netron](https://netron.app/).
2. Open the exported ONNX model (`transformer_model.onnx`) with Netron.
3. Inspect the graph visually to confirm the input and output names.

### Example Output:

When running the above inspection code using the `onnx` library, you should see output similar to:

```
Inputs:
input_ids
attention_mask

Outputs:
output
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that the names you specified during export (`input_names` and `output_names`) match the actual names used in your model graph.
- If your model includes additional inputs or outputs, you will need to specify and inspect those names accordingly.
- The `dynamic_axes` argument is useful for handling dynamic input sizes.

By following these steps, you can confirm that your transformer model has been correctly exported to ONNX with the proper input and output names.

# tell me more about dynamic_axes argument

The `dynamic_axes` argument in the `torch.onnx.export` function is crucial when you need to handle input sizes that vary across different batches. This argument allows you to specify which dimensions of your input and output tensors are dynamic, meaning their size is not fixed and can change across different runs.

Here's a detailed explanation of the `dynamic_axes` argument and how to use it:

### Purpose of `dynamic_axes`

When exporting a PyTorch model to an ONNX format, the tensors' dimensions are typically fixed based on the provided example inputs. However, in many real-world scenarios, particularly in NLP (Natural Language Processing) and computer vision, the batch size and sequence length can vary. The `dynamic_axes` argument allows you to specify which dimensions should be treated as dynamic. This flexibility enables the exported ONNX model to handle varying input sizes without the need for re-exporting the model.

### How to Use `dynamic_axes`

The `dynamic_axes` argument is a dictionary where:
- The keys are the names of the tensors (inputs or outputs).
- The values are dictionaries mapping dimension indices to their corresponding names, indicating which dimensions are dynamic.

### Example Usage

Assume you have a transformer model with the following input and output tensors:
- `input_ids`: A tensor representing input token IDs.
- `attention_mask`: A tensor representing the attention mask.
- `output`: The output tensor from the model.

Here's how to specify dynamic axes for varying `batch_size` and `sequence_length`:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create example input
input_text = "Exporting a transformer model to ONNX"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Exporting with dynamic axes
input_names = ["input_ids", "attention_mask"]
output_names = ["output"]

dynamic_axes = {
    'input_ids': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'attention_mask': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'output': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
}

torch.onnx.export(
    model, 
    (inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask']),
    "transformer_model.onnx",
    input_names=input_names,
    output_names=output_names,
    dynamic_axes=dynamic_axes,
    opset_version=11  # Specify the ONNX opset version
)
```

### Understanding the `dynamic_axes` Argument:

- `input_ids`: The `0` dimension (batch size) and `1` dimension (sequence length) are dynamic.
- `attention_mask`: The `0` dimension (batch size) and `1` dimension (sequence length) are dynamic.
- `output`: The `0` dimension (batch size) and `1` dimension (sequence length) are dynamic.

### Notes:

1. **Ensuring Compatibility:** Ensure that the ONNX runtime or any other inference engine you use to run the exported ONNX model supports dynamic axes. Some tools might require fixed input sizes.
2. **Performance Considerations:** Handling dynamic shapes might introduce some overhead during model inference. Ensure to benchmark and validate the performance when using dynamic axes.
3. **Batch and Sequence Sizes:** When exporting the model, the provided example inputs determine the initial shapes. The `dynamic_axes` argument ensures that even if the batch size or sequence length changes during inference, the model can handle those inputs correctly.

By using the `dynamic_axes` argument, you make your ONNX model more flexible and adaptable to different input sizes, fostering better integration and usability across a variety of real-world scenarios.

# in my case, I want the sentence embedding in the final output, not the embedding for each token, how to specify the output then?

To specify the output to be the sentence embedding rather than the embedding for each token, you need to ensure that your model provides the pooled output (typically the `[CLS]` token's embedding in models like BERT) rather than the token embeddings.

Here’s how to modify the export process to output sentence embeddings:

### Step 1: Obtain Sentence Embeddings from the Model

For transformer models like BERT, the pooled output can be accessed through the `pooler_output`, which represents the aggregate representation for the input sequence.

### Example using BERT

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Tokenize input
input_text = "Exporting a transformer model to ONNX"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    sentence_embedding = outputs.pooler_output  # This is the pooled output

# Specify input and output names
input_names = ["input_ids", "attention_mask"]
output_names = ["sentence_embedding"]

dynamic_axes = {
    'input_ids': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'attention_mask': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'sentence_embedding': {0: 'batch_size'}
}

torch.onnx.export(
    model, 
    (inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask']),
    "bert_sentence_embedding.onnx",
    input_names=input_names,
    output_names=output_names,
    dynamic_axes=dynamic_axes,
    opset_version=11  # Specify the ONNX opset version
)
```

### Custom Model Wrapper

Alternatively, if your transformer model doesn't directly output the pooled representation, you can create a custom wrapper model that includes only the functionality to output the sentence embedding.

### Custom Wrapper Example

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

class SentenceEmbeddingModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        super(SentenceEmbeddingModel, self).__init__()
        self.transformer_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.transformer_model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        sentence_embedding = outputs.pooler_output  # This is the pooled output
        return sentence_embedding

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = SentenceEmbeddingModel(model_name)

# Tokenize input
input_text = "Exporting a transformer model to ONNX"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Specify input and output names
input_names = ["input_ids", "attention_mask"]
output_names = ["sentence_embedding"]

dynamic_axes = {
    'input_ids': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'attention_mask': {0: 'batch_size', 1: 'sequence_length'},
    'sentence_embedding': {0: 'batch_size'}
}

torch.onnx.export(
    model, 
    (inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask']),
    "bert_sentence_embedding.onnx",
    input_names=input_names,
    output_names=output_names,
    dynamic_axes=dynamic_axes,
    opset_version=11  # Specify the ONNX opset version
)
```

### Explanation

- **Custom Wrapper Model:** `SentenceEmbeddingModel` is a simple wrapper around the transformer model to only return the `pooler_output`.
- **Dynamic Axes:** Specify `batch_size` as dynamic for `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, and `sentence_embedding`.
- **Input and Output Names:** Ensure that `sentence_embedding` is the output name.

By using this custom wrapper, you focus on exporting the sentence embeddings, thus making the exported ONNX model suitable for your specific use case.


# in following two demo codes, why are embeddings_1 and embeddings_2 not equal?

The reason `embeddings_1` and `embeddings_2` are not equal, even though both examples use the same pre-trained model `BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5`, is due to differences in how the embeddings are computed and normalized in the `transformers` vs. `sentence-transformers` libraries.

Here's a detailed explanation of the differences:

1. **Token Embedding vs. Sentence Embedding:**
   - In the first code snippet, using the `transformers` library, you are extracting the embedding of the `[CLS]` token (`model_output[0][:, 0]`) as the sentence embedding. This procedure may or may not match the sentence embedding approach used internally by the `SentenceTransformer`.
   - In the second code snippet, using the `sentence-transformers` library, the `SentenceTransformer` model likely performs additional steps (e.g., pooling strategies, mean pooling, or max pooling over token embeddings) to create the sentence embeddings.

2. **Pooling Strategy Implementation:**
   - The `sentence-transformers` library might use a different pooling strategy (e.g., mean pooling over token embeddings) compared to the default `[CLS]` pooling used in the first code snippet.

3. **Normalization Differences:**
   - The first code snippet explicitly uses L2 normalization with `torch.nn.functional.normalize`.
   - The second code snippet uses the `normalize_embeddings=True` parameter provided by `SentenceTransformer.encode`, which might implement normalization differently or include additional steps.

To get embeddings from both approaches as close as possible, you need to ensure that the pooling and normalization strategies are consistently applied in both approaches. Here's an example of how you could more closely mimic the behavior of `SentenceTransformer` using the `transformers` library.

### Example with Mean Pooling and Normalization

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for
sentences = ["样例数据-1"]

# Load model from HuggingFace Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model.eval()

# Tokenize sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Compute token embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)
    # Perform mean pooling instead of CLS pooling
    attention_mask = encoded_input['attention_mask']
    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(model_output[0].size()).float()
    sum_embeddings = torch.sum(model_output[0] * input_mask_expanded, 1)
    sum_mask = torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)
    sentence_embeddings = sum_embeddings / sum_mask

# normalize embeddings
embeddings_1 = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)
print(embeddings_1)

# Using sentence-transformers
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
embeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences, normalize_embeddings=True)
print(embeddings_2)

# Check the difference
print(torch.allclose(embeddings_1, torch.tensor(embeddings_2), atol=1e-6))
```

### Explanation of the Mean Pooling

- The example provided uses mean pooling over token embeddings to create the sentence embedding.
- `input_mask_expanded` ensures that padding tokens are not included in the computation.
- `sum_embeddings` computes the sum of token embeddings weighted by the attention mask.
- `sum_mask` is used to normalize by the number of valid tokens.

By comparing these two approaches, you can get a better understanding of how the embeddings are constructed differently. There might still be slight differences due to implementation details and additional preprocessing steps that `SentenceTransformer` might apply internally.

# there is a model_output.pooler_output when using transformers, can it serve as sentence embedding?

Yes, `model_output.pooler_output` can serve as the sentence embedding when using the `transformers` library. This output is specifically designed to provide the aggregate representation of the entire input sequence, typically by using the embedding of the `[CLS]` token in BERT-based models. This pooling mechanism is often used for generating sentence embeddings.

Here’s how you can modify the first code snippet to use `model_output.pooler_output` directly for sentence embeddings:

### Using `pooler_output`

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for
sentences = ["样例数据-1"]

# Load model from HuggingFace Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model.eval()

# Tokenize sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Compute token embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)
    # Use pooler_output as the sentence embedding
    sentence_embeddings = model_output.pooler_output

# normalize embeddings
embeddings_1 = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)

print(embeddings_1)
```

### SentenceTransformer for Comparison

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Using sentence-transformers
sentences_1 = ["样例数据-1"]
model = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
embeddings_2 = model.encode(sentences_1, normalize_embeddings=True)

print(embeddings_2)
```

By using `pooler_output`, which represents the pooled output of your model and is typically used for sentence embeddings, you ensure that you are leveraging the built-in mechanism in the transformer model architecture to obtain the sentence's aggregated representation.

However, bear in mind that there could still be differences between embeddings obtained via `transformers` versus `sentence_transformers`. These can arise due to different defaults in preprocessing, tokenization handling, or embedding generation strategies. To help you ensure the pooling strategy correctly, here is the complete comparison:

### Complete Code Comparison

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Sentences we want sentence embeddings for
sentences = ["样例数据-1"]

# Load model from HuggingFace Hub
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
model.eval()

# Tokenize sentences
encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Compute token embeddings using transformers
with torch.no_grad():
    model_output = model(**encoded_input)
    # Use pooler_output as the sentence embedding
    sentence_embeddings = model_output.pooler_output

# normalize embeddings
embeddings_1 = torch.nn.functional.normalize(sentence_embeddings, p=2, dim=1)
print(f"Transformers embeddings: {embeddings_1}")

# Compute embeddings using sentence-transformers
model_sentence_transformer = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5')
embeddings_2 = model_sentence_transformer.encode(sentences, normalize_embeddings=True)
print(f"Sentence-transformers embeddings: {embeddings_2}")

# Verify similarity
difference = torch.norm(embeddings_1 - torch.tensor(embeddings_2))
print(f"Difference between embeddings: {difference}")
```

### Notes:

- `pooler_output` is the pooled representation commonly used for sentence-level embeddings in BERT-like models.
- Normalization is applied using `torch.nn.functional.normalize` to ensure embeddings are comparable in magnitude.
- The comparison of the two embeddings (`difference`) helps understand variations due to different defaults in embedding computation strategies.

By following this approach, you utilize the capabilities of the `transformers` library to produce sentence embeddings that can be directly compared to those generated by `sentence-transformers`.

# what does 'hidden state' mean in transformers?

In the context of transformer models, such as BERT or GPT, the term "hidden state" refers to the intermediate representations of the input data as it passes through the layers of the model. These representations are often vectors or tensors that capture various features and patterns in the data, and they are critical to the functioning of the model.

### Explanation of Hidden States

1. **Initial Embedding Layer:**
   - The input tokens are first converted into vectors (embeddings) that capture their semantic meanings. This is often done using an embedding layer, which maps each token to a fixed-size dense vector.

2. **Transformer Layers:**
   - The embeddings are then processed by a series of transformer layers. Each transformer layer typically consists of multi-head self-attention mechanisms followed by position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks.
   - As the input data propagates through these layers, the hidden states are updated. Each layer transforms the hidden states passed from the previous layer, refining and condensing the information.

3. **Final Hidden States:**
   - The outputs of the last transformer layer are considered the final hidden states. For each token in the input sequence, there is a corresponding hidden state that encapsulates context-specific information learned by the model.

### Why Hidden States Matter

- **Feature Extraction:** Hidden states are rich vectors that encode various features of the input, making them useful for downstream tasks such as classification, named entity recognition, and more.
- **Contextual Understanding:** These states capture not just the meaning of individual tokens, but also their relationships and dependencies within the context of the entire input sequence.

### Example: BERT's Hidden States

In BERT, the hidden states are of two main types:
1. **Token-Level Hidden States:** For each token in the input sequence, there is a corresponding hidden state vector which encapsulates the processed information for that token.
2. **Pooled Output (`pooler_output`):** A special hidden state associated with the `[CLS]` token, often used as a summary representation of the entire input sequence for classification tasks.

Here's how to access hidden states in practice:

### Accessing Hidden States Using the `transformers` Library

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, output_hidden_states=True)

# Tokenize input text
input_text = "Hidden states in transformers are very informative."
encoded_input = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')

# Forward pass to get model's outputs
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**encoded_input)

# Retrieve hidden states from all layers
hidden_states = outputs.hidden_states

# Access hidden states of the last layer
last_hidden_state = hidden_states[-1]

print(f"Shape of last hidden state: {last_hidden_state.shape}")
```

### Structure of Hidden States

- **Shape of Hidden States:**
  - Typically, the hidden states for each token have a shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]`.
  - For example, if you have a batch with 1 sequence of length 10, and a hidden size of 768 (as in BERT-base), the shape will be `(1, 10, 768)`.

### Summary

- **Initial Embedding:** Converts tokens to initial vectors.
- **Transformer Layers:** Process embeddings through multiple layers, updating hidden states.
- **Final Hidden States:** Capture rich contextualized information, useful for various NLP tasks.

By understanding and leveraging hidden states, you can extract meaningful representations from transformer models, enabling their application in a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
