# what is the difference between protobuffer, thrift, flatbuffer?

Great question! **Protocol Buffers (protobuf), Thrift, and FlatBuffers** are all serialization frameworks designed to efficiently encode structured data, but they differ in design goals, usage patterns, and performance characteristics. Here’s a detailed comparison:

---

## 1. **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)**

- **Developer:** Google
- **Purpose:** Efficient, extensible, language-neutral serialization of structured data.
- **Serialization:** Binary format.
- **Schema:** Requires `.proto` schema files defining messages and fields.
- **Encoding:** Compact, tag-based binary encoding.
- **Usage:** Widely used for RPC, data storage, and communication.
- **Parsing:**  
  - Requires parsing/unpacking the serialized data into objects before use.  
  - Parsing cost is moderate.
- **Mutability:** Data is typically deserialized into mutable objects.
- **Backward/Forward Compatibility:** Good support via field numbering and optional fields.
- **Features:**  
  - Supports nested messages, enums, repeated fields, optional/required fields.  
  - Supports code generation for many languages.
- **Example Use Case:** gRPC communication, config files, data interchange.

---

## 2. **Thrift**

- **Developer:** Originally Facebook, now Apache Thrift.
- **Purpose:** Cross-language RPC framework with serialization.
- **Serialization:** Binary and other formats (compact, JSON, etc.).
- **Schema:** Requires `.thrift` IDL files defining data structures and services.
- **Encoding:** Compact binary encoding optimized for RPC.
- **Usage:** RPC framework + serialization.
- **Parsing:** Requires deserialization before use.
- **Mutability:** Objects are mutable after deserialization.
- **Backward/Forward Compatibility:** Good support with optional fields and versioning.
- **Features:**  
  - Defines both data structures and RPC service interfaces.  
  - Supports many languages.  
  - Includes transport and protocol layers for network communication.
- **Example Use Case:** Building RPC services with cross-language clients/servers.

---

## 3. **FlatBuffers**

- **Developer:** Google
- **Purpose:** Fast serialization library optimized for **zero-copy** access.
- **Serialization:** Binary format.
- **Schema:** Requires `.fbs` schema files.
- **Encoding:** Flat, memory-mapped format with offsets instead of pointers.
- **Usage:** Designed for performance-critical applications like games, mobile, and embedded systems.
- **Parsing:**  
  - **No parsing/unpacking needed**: data can be accessed **directly** in serialized form without deserialization.  
  - Enables zero-copy reads.
- **Mutability:** Data is **immutable** once serialized; to modify, you rebuild the buffer.
- **Backward/Forward Compatibility:** Supports schema evolution with optional fields and defaults.
- **Features:**  
  - Very fast access to data without unpacking.  
  - Supports tables, vectors, unions, nested objects.  
  - Smaller runtime overhead.
- **Example Use Case:** Game engines, real-time systems, mobile apps where speed and memory efficiency are critical.

## When to choose which?

- Choose **protobuf** if you want a widely supported, efficient serialization format with good tooling and RPC support (e.g., gRPC).
- Choose **Thrift** if you want an integrated RPC framework with serialization and support for many languages.
- Choose **FlatBuffers** if you need **ultra-fast, zero-copy access** to serialized data without parsing overhead, especially in performance-critical or memory-constrained environments.

# how does flatbuffer maintain compatibility of a schema?

Great question! FlatBuffers is designed to support **forward and backward compatibility** of schemas, allowing you to evolve data formats over time without breaking existing binaries or requiring full reserialization. Here’s how FlatBuffers maintains schema compatibility:

---

## 1. Key Principles of FlatBuffers Schema Compatibility

### a) **Optional Fields with Defaults**

- Fields in FlatBuffers tables are **optional by default**.
- If a field is missing in serialized data, FlatBuffers uses the **default value** specified in the schema.
- This means **new fields can be added** without breaking old readers that don’t know about them.

### b) **Adding New Fields**

- You can add new fields **at the end** of a table in the schema.
- Older binaries that don’t know about these fields simply ignore them.
- New binaries reading old data see the default values for those new fields.

### c) **Removing Fields**

- Removing fields is safe **only if you don’t reuse the same field ID**.
- The field slot remains unused, so older binaries that expect the field still work if the data contains it.
- To maintain compatibility, avoid reusing field numbers.

### d) **Field Ordering**

- Field order in the schema **does not affect the serialized data layout** because FlatBuffers uses **field IDs (offsets)** internally.
- This means you can **reorder fields** in the schema without breaking compatibility.

### e) **Deprecation**

- Fields can be deprecated by simply no longer using them in new code.
- Old data containing deprecated fields still works because FlatBuffers can skip unknown fields.

---

## 2. How FlatBuffers Stores Data to Support Compatibility

- FlatBuffers tables store fields as **offsets** from the start of the table.
- Each field has a **field ID (vtable offset)**.
- When reading, FlatBuffers looks up fields by ID, so missing fields are handled gracefully.
- Unknown fields are simply ignored by parsers that don’t recognize them.

---

## 3. Summary of Compatibility Rules

| Change Type           | Compatible?                  | Notes                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Add new field (at end) | Yes                         | New readers see new field; old readers ignore it |
| Remove field           | Yes, if field ID not reused | Old data still contains field; avoid reuse     |
| Change field type      | No                          | Can break compatibility                         |
| Reorder fields         | Yes                         | Field IDs used, so order doesn’t matter        |
| Rename field           | Yes                         | Name only affects schema, not binary format    |

---

## 4. Example

```fbs
// Version 1
table Monster {
  hp:int = 100;
  mana:int = 150;
}

// Version 2 (added new field)
table Monster {
  hp:int = 100;
  mana:int = 150;
  name:string;  // new optional field
}
```

- Old binaries reading Version 2 data ignore `name`.
- New binaries reading Version 1 data see `name` as `null` or default.

---

## 5. Best Practices for Schema Evolution in FlatBuffers

- Always **add new fields at the end**.
- Avoid changing field types or semantics.
- Avoid reusing field IDs.
- Use default values for new fields.
- Use versioning in your application logic if needed.

If you want, I can help you with example FlatBuffers schemas showing compatible changes or how to handle schema evolution in code!


# show me an example of flatbuffer schema with field IDs

Great! In FlatBuffers, **field IDs** (also called *field offsets*) are implicit and managed automatically by the FlatBuffers compiler (`flatc`). You don't explicitly assign numeric IDs to fields like in Protocol Buffers or Thrift. Instead, the **order of fields in the schema** determines their field IDs (starting from zero), but since FlatBuffers uses a *vtable* internally, the actual binary layout uses these IDs to locate fields efficiently and support compatibility.

---

## What Are Field IDs in FlatBuffers?

- Each field in a table has an implicit **field ID**, which is its zero-based index in the schema.
- For example, the first field has field ID 0, the second field ID 1, and so on.
- These IDs are used internally in the **vtable** (virtual table) to find the offset of the field in the serialized data.
- Because of this, you can reorder fields in the schema without breaking compatibility, as the vtable maps field IDs to offsets.

---

## Example FlatBuffers Schema and Explanation

```fbs
namespace Example;

table Monster {
  hp:int = 100;          // field ID 0
  mana:int = 150;        // field ID 1
  name:string;           // field ID 2
  friendly:bool = false; // field ID 3
}
```

### Explanation:

| Field    | Position in Schema | Field ID (implicit) | Default Value |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| hp       | 1st field          | 0                   | 100           |
| mana     | 2nd field          | 1                   | 150           |
| name     | 3rd field          | 2                   | (none)        |
| friendly | 4th field          | 3                   | false         |

---

## How Field IDs Are Used Internally

- When a `Monster` object is serialized, FlatBuffers generates a **vtable** that stores offsets for each field by their field ID.
- When reading, FlatBuffers looks up the field ID in the vtable to find the field’s location.
- Missing fields (not present in serialized data) are handled gracefully by checking the vtable.

---

## Important Notes

- You **do not specify field IDs explicitly** in FlatBuffers schemas.
- To maintain compatibility, **do not reorder fields arbitrarily** if you want to keep human readability, but FlatBuffers can handle field reordering internally via the vtable.
- When adding new fields, add them at the end to avoid confusion and maintain schema clarity.

---

## Summary

| FlatBuffers Concept | Explanation                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Field ID            | Implicit zero-based index of field |
| Vtable              | Maps field IDs to offsets in data  |
| Schema ordering     | Determines field IDs                |
| Compatibility       | Supports missing/new fields via vtable |

---

If you want, I can show you how to inspect the vtable or how FlatBuffers handles field IDs at the binary level!

# so if I don't specify field ID explicitly in a flatbuffer schema, I am not supposed to change the order of fields in a table definitions

Exactly! In FlatBuffers, **field IDs are implicitly assigned based on the order of fields in the schema**, starting from zero. So:

- **Changing the order of fields in a table definition effectively changes their field IDs.**
- Since the binary format relies on these field IDs (via the vtable) to locate fields, **reordering fields breaks compatibility with previously serialized data**.

---

### What does this mean in practice?

- **Do NOT reorder existing fields** in your FlatBuffers schema if you want to maintain backward and forward compatibility.
- If you want to add new fields, **always append them at the end** of the table.
- If you reorder fields, old binaries will interpret the fields incorrectly because the field IDs no longer match.

---

### Why?

FlatBuffers uses a **vtable** that maps field IDs (indices) to offsets in the serialized data. If field IDs change due to reordering, the mapping breaks, causing incorrect data reads.

---

### Summary

| Action                 | Compatibility Impact                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Add new fields at end   | Compatible                             |
| Reorder existing fields | **Breaks compatibility**               |
| Remove fields (without reusing IDs) | Compatible (old fields ignored) |

---

### Best practice

- Keep field order stable once deployed.
- Append new fields only at the end.
- Use default values for new fields.

---

If you want, I can show you an example illustrating what happens if you reorder fields and how it breaks compatibility! Would you like that?

# what does the vtable look like in flatbuffer?

Great question! The **vtable (virtual table)** is a core part of FlatBuffers’ binary format that enables efficient, flexible, and backward/forward-compatible access to table fields. Let me explain what the vtable looks like and how it works.

---

## What is a vtable in FlatBuffers?

- The **vtable** is a small block of metadata stored alongside each table in the FlatBuffers binary.
- It acts like a **lookup table** that maps **field IDs** (field indices) to their **offsets** inside the table's data.
- Because FlatBuffers tables are **sparse** (fields are optional and may be missing), the vtable tells the parser where each field is located or if it’s missing.
- This indirection allows:
  - Fields to be **optional**.
  - Fields to be **added or removed** without breaking compatibility.
  - Fields to be **reordered** in the schema without changing the binary layout (though reordering fields in the schema is discouraged for clarity).

---

## Vtable Structure Overview

The vtable is stored just **before** the table data in the binary buffer. It contains:

1. **Length of the vtable (in bytes)**  
   The total size of the vtable, including this length field.

2. **Length of the table (in bytes)**  
   The size of the table data (the actual field data).

3. **Offsets for each field**  
   For each field in the table schema, the vtable stores a 2-byte offset (relative to the start of the table data) where that field’s data can be found.

---

## Visual Representation

```
+---------------------------+
| vtable length (2 bytes)   |  <-- total size of vtable in bytes
+---------------------------+
| table length (2 bytes)    |  <-- size of the table data in bytes
+---------------------------+
| offset to field 0 (2 bytes) |  <-- 0 if field missing
+---------------------------+
| offset to field 1 (2 bytes) |  <-- 0 if field missing
+---------------------------+
| offset to field 2 (2 bytes) |  <-- ...
+---------------------------+
| ...                       |
+---------------------------+
| Table data starts here -->|
+---------------------------+
| Field 0 data              |
+---------------------------+
| Field 1 data              |
+---------------------------+
| Field 2 data              |
+---------------------------+
| ...                       |
+---------------------------+
```

- Each offset is relative to the **start of the table data** (not the start of the vtable).
- If a field is **missing**, its offset in the vtable is `0`.
- The table data contains the actual serialized values of the fields.

---

## How it works in practice

- When reading a table, FlatBuffers first reads the pointer to the vtable.
- It reads the vtable length and table length.
- To access a field, it looks up the field's offset in the vtable.
- If offset is non-zero, it reads the field data at `table_start + offset`.
- If offset is zero, the field is missing and the default value is used.

---

## Example

Suppose you have a table with three fields:

```fbs
table Example {
  a:int;      // field 0
  b:float;    // field 1
  c:string;   // field 2
}
```

If only `a` and `c` are present, the vtable might look like:

| vtable length | table length | offset to a | offset to b | offset to c |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10 bytes      | 12 bytes     | 4           | 0           | 8           |

- `offset to b` is 0 because `b` is missing.
- The table data then contains the actual bytes for `a` and `c` at offsets 4 and 8 respectively.

---

## Why is the vtable important?

- It enables **optional fields** without wasting space.
- Supports **schema evolution** by allowing new fields to be added or removed.
- Allows **fast random access** to fields without scanning the entire table.
- Enables **backward and forward compatibility**.

---

## Summary

| Concept        | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| vtable         | Metadata block mapping field IDs to offsets  |
| Size fields    | vtable length and table length (2 bytes each)|
| Offsets        | 2-byte offsets per field (0 if field missing)|
| Purpose        | Support optional fields and schema evolution |

---

If you want, I can show you a hex dump example of a FlatBuffers buffer illustrating the vtable layout! Would you like that?

# from your explanation, the maximum data size of a table is 65535 since table length is stored in a 2-byte buffer?

Excellent observation! Let's clarify this point about the **table length field size** and its implications on the maximum size of a FlatBuffers table.

---

## Recap of the Table Length Field

- In the FlatBuffers binary format, the **table length** is stored as a **2-byte unsigned integer** (uint16).
- This means the maximum value it can represent is **65535 bytes** (i.e., 2^16 - 1).

---

## Does this limit the table size to 65535 bytes?

**Yes and no.**

- **Yes**, the `table length` field itself is 2 bytes, so it can only represent sizes up to 65535 bytes for the *table's data block*.
- **No**, this does **not necessarily limit the entire FlatBuffer or the entire serialized data size** to 65535 bytes.

---

## What exactly does the "table length" represent?

- The **table length** field indicates the size of the **table data block**, i.e., the contiguous bytes holding the fields' values for that particular table.
- A FlatBuffer file can contain **many tables and other objects**, each with their own vtables and table length fields.
- The overall FlatBuffer buffer can be much larger than 65535 bytes because it can contain multiple tables, vectors, strings, and nested objects.

---

## Practical implications

- **A single table's data block is limited to 65535 bytes.**
- If you have a table with many fields or very large fields (e.g., large strings or vectors), you might hit this limit.
- To handle very large data, you can:
  - Break data into multiple tables or vectors.
  - Use vectors of tables or other nested structures to avoid one huge table.
  
---

## Why 2 bytes?

- Using 2 bytes for offsets and sizes keeps the FlatBuffers format compact and efficient.
- FlatBuffers is optimized for fast access and low overhead, targeting use cases like games and mobile apps where huge monolithic tables are rare.

---

## Summary

| Aspect                  | Explanation                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Table length field size | 2 bytes (uint16)                        |
| Max table size          | 65535 bytes (per table data block)      |
| Overall FlatBuffer size | Can be much larger, multiple tables/objects |
| Workaround for large data | Use nested tables, vectors, or multiple buffers |

---

If you want, I can show you examples on how to structure large data in FlatBuffers to avoid this limit! Would you like that?

# in flatbuffer how to store nested structures, do the data of child tables store inside the parent table? I wonder how large data are stored since the maximum data size of a table is 64KB

Great questions! Let's clarify how **nested tables** work in FlatBuffers and how large data is handled given the table size limit.

---

## 1. How are nested tables stored in FlatBuffers?

- **Nested tables are NOT stored inline inside the parent table’s data block.**
- Instead, the parent table stores a **relative offset (pointer)** to the child table elsewhere in the FlatBuffer binary.
- The child table is stored **separately** (usually after the parent table) in the buffer.
- The parent table’s field for the nested table is just a **4-byte offset** (relative to the parent table start) pointing to the child table.

### Visual example:

```
[Parent Table Data]
  - Field 1: int
  - Field 2: offset to Child Table (4 bytes)

[Child Table Data]
  - Its own fields, vtable, etc.
```

---

## 2. Why is this design used?

- It keeps the parent table **compact** and fixed-size for its fields.
- Enables **efficient random access** to nested objects without copying or unpacking.
- Supports **optional nested tables** (offset can be zero/null).
- Allows **sharing and reuse** of nested tables if needed.

---

## 3. How does this relate to the 64KB table size limit?

- The **64KB limit applies only to the size of the parent table’s own data block**, not the entire FlatBuffer.
- Since nested tables are stored separately and referenced by offsets, the parent table remains small.
- Large data is stored in **separate tables or vectors**, each with their own size limits.
- The overall FlatBuffer buffer can be much larger than 64KB, composed of many linked tables and vectors.

---

## 4. How are large arrays or strings handled?

- Large arrays or strings are stored as **vectors** elsewhere in the buffer.
- The parent table stores an offset to the vector.
- Vectors themselves can be large, but each vector has its own length field and data block.
- This modular design avoids a single monolithic table exceeding size limits.

---

## 5. Summary

| Concept               | Explanation                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Nested tables         | Stored separately, parent holds offset pointer |
| Table size limit      | Applies per table data block (~64KB max)        |
| Large data           | Stored in separate tables or vectors             |
| Overall buffer size  | Can be much larger than 64KB                      |

---

## 6. Example schema snippet

```fbs
table Child {
  value:int;
}

table Parent {
  id:int;
  child:Child;  // stored as offset to Child table
  data:[ubyte]; // vector of bytes, stored separately
}
```

---

If you want, I can help you with example code that builds and accesses nested tables and large vectors in FlatBuffers! Would you like that?

# so in the parent table, the field value of a child table is the pointer pointing to the child table data?

```cpp
// flatbuffers/include/flatbuffers/base.h
// Signed offsets for references that can go in both directions.
typedef int32_t soffset_t;
typedef int64_t soffset64_t;

// Offset/index used in v-tables, can be changed to uint8_t in
// format forks to save a bit of space if desired.
typedef uint16_t voffset_t;

typedef uintmax_t largest_scalar_t;

// In 32bits, this evaluates to 2GB - 1
#define FLATBUFFERS_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (std::numeric_limits<::flatbuffers::soffset_t>::max)()
#define FLATBUFFERS_MAX_64_BUFFER_SIZE (std::numeric_limits<::flatbuffers::soffset64_t>::max)()
```
